## Description
- I built this app to learn how to build and deploy a full-stack web application using Python. 
- This app feature's a Flask API and connects to an RDBMS database using SQL Alchemy. The newsfeed and user data is fed from a REST API that performs CRUD operations. A Jinja templating engine is used to allow from front-end user interactions.
- The app has user authentication. The app utilizes API routes for signup, login, and logout. Logins persist in a session, and API routes are auth protected through the use of middleware/decorators.

## Usage
- Users can view the /dashboard to see trending articles.
- Users can view posts, create posts, update posts, add comments, and upvote different posts. 
- Users can sign-up, login, or logout by following the links in the navigation bar.
