# python-newsfeed

## Description
- I built this app to learn how to build and deploy a full-stack web application using Python. 
- This app feature's a Flask API and connects to an RDBMS database using SQL Alchemy. The newsfeed and user data is fed from a REST API that performs CRUD operations. A Jinja templating engine is used to allow from front-end user interactions.
